Counseling and Psychological Services: 
Graduate school can be complicated and challenging. You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. The [URI Counseling Center](https://web.uri.edu/counseling/) provides confidential support for the personal, emotional, and academic well-being of our students. These services include individual counseling, group counseling, and referrals.
